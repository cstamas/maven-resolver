This module provides default implementation for interface `org.eclipse.aether.spi.synccontext.SyncContextFactory` that
is able to delegate to three implementation:

- `named` (the default) is backed by Named Locks, and provide locks for MT and MP builds.
- `global` (was experimental in pre 1.7.0 version) is using single JVM
  `java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock` to protect read and write actions, hence suitable in MT
  builds only. But even in MT builds, is inferior from `named` due congestion on single lock instance.
- `nolock` (was default in pre 1.7.0 version) is actually a no-op implementation. It is fundamentally flawed, as
  even single threaded builds may produce concurrency issues (see MRESOLVER-153). Should not be used by end-users.

To choose which SyncContextFactory you want to use, the `aether.syncContext.impl` JVM System property should be set
to some value from those above. In case of wrong value, the factory constructor, hence, Maven itself will fail to
initialize. The default value used if none is set by user is `named`.

Warning: if you use `ServiceLocator` same (default) behaviour may be observed, but the NamedLockFactory instance is
limited to default "JVM local" (MT) lock factory only.

${esc.hash}${esc.hash} Configuration options for "named" SyncContextFactory

You can control and configure several aspects of Named Locks SyncContextFactory:

- `aether.syncContext.named.timeOut` (optional, default is 30): the time out value for being blocked on a lock.
- `aether.syncContext.named.timeUnit` (optional, default is `java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit.SECONDS`): the time unit
  of time out value.
- `aether.syncContext.named.factory` (optional, default is `rwlock-local`): the Named Lock factory to be used.
- `aether.syncContext.named.discriminator` (optional): A discriminator uniquely identifying a host and local
  repository pair.

For the `aether.syncContext.named.factory` property following values are allowed:

- `rwlock-local` (default), usable for MT builds.
- `semaphore-local`, usable for MT builds.
- `semaphore-hazelcast`, distributed, usable with MT and MP builds, **extra setup needed**.
- `semaphore-hazelcast-client`, distributed, usable with MT and MP builds, **extra setup needed**.
- `rwlock-redisson`, distributed, usable with MT and MP builds, **extra setup needed**.
- `semaphore-redisson`, distributed, usable with MT and MP builds, **extra setup needed**.
